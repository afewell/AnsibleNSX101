# Virtual Network Configuration
In the previous labs, you installed NSX Manager, registered it with vCenter and setup control and data plane components. NSX is now ready to start providing virtual network & security services. This section covers the configuration and provisioning of edge routing, distributed routing and logical switching. 

This Lab includes the following sections:

-->
## Logical Switching
In this section, you will make a playbook to create each of the logical switches required to complete the Lab 4 Virtual Networking Topology. 
[Click here to see a video walk-through of this section](https://youtu.be/vpUC7aRlNGI)

### About the playbook
- An NSX Logical switch can be created with a single task
    - The playbook you create in this section will use 4 copies of the same task to create 4 logical switches, TransitLS, WebLS, AppLS and DBLS. 
    - [Documentation for the nsx_logical_switch module](https://github.com/vmware/nsxansible#module-nsx_deploy_ova)

![lsVerify](Images/lsVerify.PNG)

## Distributed Routing
Now that you have created the logical switches for the lab environment, you will need to implement routing services to enable IP connectivity between the logical switch subnets. In this section you will create a playbook to install and configure distributing routing services. 
[Click here to see a video walk-through of this section](https://youtu.be/7qpv-5ABiW4)

### About the playbook
In this section you will prepare and execute a playbook that will create and provide the basic configuration for an NSX Distributed Logical Router (DLR). This DLR will serve as the default gateway for virtual machines connected to the WebLS, AppLS and DBLS Logical Switches that you created in the previous section on [Logical Switching](). The DLR will also connect to the TransitLS Logical Switch created in the previous section, and it will use the TransitLS network to connect to an NSX Edge Services Gateway you will create in the next section. 

- About the playbook
    - Tasks 1-3: Gather vCenter Moids
      - Description: 
        - Before you can deploy a DLR with the `nsx-dlr` ansible module, you first need to gather the MOIDs for the resource pool or cluster, datacenter, datastore and management portgroup.  
      - [Documentation for the vcenter_gather_moids module](https://github.com/vmware/nsxansible#module-vcenter_gather_moids)

## Edge Routing
Now that you have created the logical switches for the lab environment, and a logical router to provide first-hop and east-west routing services, you will next create an edge services gateway and configure it to provide north-south routing services to serve as a gateway for traffic flows that go between the virtual and physical routing environments. 
[Click here to see a video walk-through of this section](https://youtu.be/60Thzq3U884)

### About the playbook
In this section you will create and provide the basic configuration for an NSX Edge Services Gateway (ESG). This ESG will serve as a gateway between the virtual and physical routing environments. 

- The installation and configuration of the ESG requires several tasks that interact with multiple NSX Ansible modules. 
    - Tasks 1-3: Gather vCenter Moids
      - Description: 
        - Before you can deploy an ESG with the `nsx-edge-router` ansible module, you first need to gather the MOIDs for the resource pool or cluster, datacenter, datastore and management portgroup.

    - Username: admin
    - Password: VMware1!VMware1!
  - Ping the DLR (192.168.101.2) to verify IP connectivity

## Dynamic Routing
Now that you have created the logical switches for the lab environment and installed routers, you need to enable dynamic routing to allow the routers to learn new routes from adjacent routers. 
[Click here to see a video walk-through of this section](https://youtu.be/SKDrpCTqNvs)

### About the playbook
In this section you will prepare and execute a playbook that will configure OSPF routing on both the ESG & DLR Routers. The DLR will be configured to redistributed its directly connected networks (TransitLS, WebLS, AppLS and DBLS networks) into OSPF. The ESG will be configured to peer with the DLR and learn routes to the Logical Switch subnets. 

The ESG will also be configured to peer with another Northbound router (vpod_router) that is present in the OneCloud environment to provide external connectivity. If you are not a onecloud user, instructions for setting up a vpod router equivalent are not provided, but feel free to use any physical or virtual OSPF capable router. You also do not need to replicate any excercises or configuration steps related to vpod_router as there are no significant ongoing dependencies on it. 

- About the Playbook
    - Task 1: Configure OSPF DLR
      - __Important__ you may need to modify the playbook below with the vnic number of the DLR's "Upink_vnic". 
        - Open a connection to the vSphere web client
        - Click on "Networking & Security"
        - Click on "NSX Edges"
        - Double click on "ansibleDLR"
        - Under Settings > Interfaces, identify the vNIC # of the "Uplink_vnic". For example Uplink_vnic uses vNIC #2 in the image below
![vnicVerify](Images/vnicVerify.PNG)  
        - Observe in the plabook below under the 'Configure OSPF DLR' task, the line "{ area_id: 0, vnic: 2 }"
        - If your Uplink_vnic number is 2, you do not need to change this setting, but if you have a different vnic number, be sure to change this value in the playbook to your vnic number before running it.
      - Description: 
        - This task configures OSPF on the DLR created earlier in this lab 
      - [Documentation for the nsx_ospf module](https://github.com/vmware/nsxansible#module-nsx_ospf)
    - Task 2: Configure OSPF ESG
      - Description:
        - This task configures OSPF on the ESG created earlier in this lab
      - [Documentation for the nsx_ospf module](https://github.com/vmware/nsxansible#module-nsx_ospf)
    - Task 3: Configure OSPF Redistribution
      - Description:
        - The NSX Ansible Modules use a seperate module to configure route redistribution settings from the routing protocol configuration. This task will be used to enable automatic redistribution of directly connected interfaces into OSPF advertisements generated by the DLR. 
      - [Documentation for the nsx_redistribution module](https://github.com/vmware/nsxansible#module-nsx_redistribution)
